This molecule is structurally unique within the provided set, with a maximum Tanimoto similarity of 0.21 to any other molecule. It combines a proven heterocyclic core with a stereochemically-defined piperidine linker and a fluorinated aromatic tail, offering multiple, well-defined vectors for analog generation while maintaining favorable drug-like properties."
SEH,seed_2,O=C(Nc1ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc1)N1CCCC2(CCN(C(=O)c3c(F)cccc3F)CC2)C1,0.95,"Selected for its highly desirable spiro[piperidine-4,4'-piperidine] core. This rigid, three-dimensional scaffold is excellent for exploring non-flat chemical space, which can lead to improved selectivity and physicochemical properties. It is highly dissimilar from the other seeds (max similarity of 0.19), representing a distinct and modern structural class in drug design. The defined exit vectors from the spirocycle make it an ideal starting point for a generative model."
SEH,seed_3,C[C@]12C[C@@H]3C[C@](C)(C1)C[C@@](NC(=O)Nc1ccc(CN4CCCC(C(N)=O)C4)cc1F)(C3)C2,0.85,"This molecule was chosen as a representative of a highly sp3-rich, rigid cage-like scaffold class (adamantane-like). Its extreme rigidity can lock in a specific bioactive conformation, potentially leading to high potency and selectivity. It is the simplest representative of its structural cluster (molecules 2, 7, 8) and provides maximum topological diversity against the flexible aromatic (seed 1) and spirocyclic (seed 2) scaffolds, with a pairwise similarity below 0.2. While its size and potential lipophilicity present challenges, its unique structure is valuable for exploring novel chemical space."
HDAC,seed_1,Cn1c(C(=O)Nc2cccc3c2N(Cc2ccc(OC4CCNCC4)cc2)CCC3)cc2ccccc21,0.9,"This molecule is selected as a representative of a distinct chemical cluster characterized by a large, rigid, fused tetracyclic scaffold (tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole). Its high complexity and rigidity provide a strong starting point for exploring a well-defined conformational space. Its pairwise similarity to the other two seeds is low (0.34 and 0.14), ensuring it covers a unique area of chemical space. The structure contains multiple, well-understood functional groups (amide, basic amine, ether) for modification."
HDAC,seed_2,Nc1nnc(CN[C@@H]2C[C@H]2c2ccc(OCc3ccccc3)cc2)o1,0.95,"Chosen for its exceptional structural novelty and dissimilarity to all other molecules in the set (maximum Tanimoto similarity of 0.29). The core feature is the strained bicyclo[1.1.0]butyl group, a modern 3D scaffold that can improve physicochemical properties and explore novel intellectual property space. Being smaller and more fragment-like, it is an ideal seed for generating less complex analogs. The combination of the 3D core with the aminoxadiazole heterocycle makes it a highly promising and diverse starting point."
HDAC,seed_3,CCOCc1cccc(NC(=O)c2cc3sccc3n2C)c1COc1ccc(OC[C@H]2CCNC2)cc1,0.85,"This molecule represents the prevalent thieno[2,3-b]pyridine scaffold but with a unique connectivity pattern compared to its more similar analogs. It utilizes an amide linker instead of a direct heterocycle-heterocycle bond, which introduces different geometric and electronic properties. This makes it a structurally distinct member of its class, maximizing overall diversity while still representing an important chemotype from the dataset. Its high flexibility and presence of a stereocenter offer additional avenues for exploration by a generative model."
CGAS,seed_1,O=C1N=C(N2CCCCC2)S/C1=C1/C(=O)Nc2ccccc21,0.95,"Selected for its high structural novelty and excellent drug-like properties (Lipinski's Rule of Five compliant). The rigid, spirocyclic scaffold is highly distinct from other candidates (Tanimoto < 0.15 to all others), providing a unique starting point for exploring new chemical space. The piperidine and isatin moieties offer clear vectors for modification. Its novelty and favorable physicochemical profile make it a high-confidence seed."
CGAS,seed_2,O=C(NCCCNc1nc(Nc2cccc(NC(=O)N3CCCC3)c2)ncc1I)c1cccs1,0.9,"This molecule represents a well-established 'drug-like' chemical space, featuring a diaminopyrimidine core common in kinase inhibitors. It is chosen to provide a more conventional, lower-risk starting point for generation. Its high dissimilarity to the other two selected seeds (Tanimoto < 0.15) ensures diversity. While the molecule itself is large, the scaffold is validated and offers numerous points for analog synthesis to optimize properties."
CGAS,seed_3,COc1c(O)cc2oc3cc(O)c(CC=C(C)C)c(O)c3c(=O)c2c1CC=C(C)C,0.85,"Chosen to represent a natural product-like chemical space, which is often a source of unique and potent bioactive molecules. The coumestan core with two prenyl groups is structurally unique among the candidates (Tanimoto < 0.1 to most). While the multiple phenolic groups could pose ADME challenges or lead to promiscuous binding, this scaffold provides a fundamentally different and biologically-relevant starting point, maximizing the exploratory potential of the generator."
DYRK1A,seed_1,O=c1oc2cc(O)ccc2c2c1[nH]c1ccc(O)cc12,0.95,"This molecule is selected for its profound structural uniqueness compared to the rest of the set. Its Tanimoto similarity to all other molecules is extremely low (<0.1), indicating it represents a completely different chemical class and scaffold. The coumarin-indole hybrid structure offers multiple points for modification and contains valuable pharmacophoric features (H-bond donors/acceptors), making it an excellent and diverse starting point for generation."
DYRK1A,seed_2,COC(=N)c1nc2ccc3ncnc(Nc4ccc(C)cc4)c3c2s1,0.9,"This molecule is chosen as a representative of the large thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine cluster. It features the simplest, non-halogenated substituent (a methyl group) on the terminal phenyl ring, providing a minimalistic and clean baseline for this scaffold. It was selected to maximize diversity against the third seed while representing the core structure of the most populated chemical series."
DYRK1A,seed_3,COC(=N)c1nc2ccc3ncnc(Nc4ccc(OC)cc4F)c3c2s1,0.85,"Selected to provide intra-cluster diversity, this molecule is one of the most dissimilar to Seed 2 within the main thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine series (Tanimoto similarity of 0.62). Its substituents (methoxy and fluorine) introduce different electronic properties and hydrogen-bond accepting capability compared to the simple alkyl group in Seed 2. This choice encourages the exploration of a different region of SAR for the dominant scaffold."
SGLT2,seed_1,OC[C@H]1O[C@]2(OCc3cc(Cl)c(Cc4ccc(OC(F)(F)F)cc4)cc32)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]1O,0.9,"This molecule was selected for its highly unique and rigid spiro-C-glycoside scaffold. The spiro-ether fusion between the glucose moiety and the chromane-like ring system is structurally distinct from all other candidates, as reflected by its low Tanimoto similarities to the rest of the set (average similarity of ~0.3). This conformational rigidity can be beneficial for high-affinity binding. The trifluoromethoxy group is also a desirable feature, often improving metabolic stability and cell permeability. This seed is excellent for exploring a novel region of chemical space."
SGLT2,seed_2,CCOc1ccc(Cc2cc([C@@H]3O[C@H](SC)[C@@H](O)[C@H](O)[C@H]3O)cc(OC)c2Cl)cc1,0.95,"This molecule was chosen as the most dissimilar candidate to the first seed (Tanimoto similarity of 0.26). Its key distinguishing feature is the S-glycosidic linkage (thioglycoside), which sets it apart from the C- and O-glycosides in the list. S-glycosides are known to have increased stability against enzymatic hydrolysis by glycosidases compared to O-glycosides, which is a significant advantage for drug development. This seed provides an excellent starting point to explore the impact of this bioisosteric linkage on activity and ADME properties."
SGLT2,seed_3,C=Cc1ccc(Cc2cc([C@H]3O[C@@H](CO)[C@H](O)[C@@H](O)[C@@H]3O)c3c(c2Cl)OCC3)cc1,0.85,"This molecule was selected to represent the largest chemical cluster in the dataset (molecules 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) while maintaining maximal diversity from the first two seeds (Tanimoto scores of 0.29 and 0.30, respectively). The aglycone features a fused dihydrofuran ring, creating a rigid tricyclic core that is distinct from the spiro- and simple diaryl systems of the other seeds. The terminal vinyl group, while a potential metabolic liability, also serves as a valuable synthetic handle for rapid library generation. Selecting this seed ensures that the main chemotype in the input data is explored."
